# Multisets

Finite multisets in Julia.

A *multiset* is an unordered collection of things with repetition permitted.

## Installation

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/scheinerman/Multisets.jl.git")
```

## Creating a multiset

```julia
M = Multiset{Type}()
```

If `Type` is omitted, this defaults to `Any`.

## Adding/deleting elements

+ `push!(M,x)` increases the multiplicity of `x` in `M` by 1. If `x` is not
already in `M`, then it is added to `M`.
+ `push!(M,x,incr)` increases the multiplicity of `x` in `M` by `incr`. We
allow `incr` to be negative to decrease the multiplicity of `x`
(but not below 0).
+ `M[x]=m` explicitly sets the multiplicty of `x` to `m`.
To delete an element from `M` use `M[x]=0`.
